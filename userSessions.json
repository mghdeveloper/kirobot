However, the previous search results and our conversation focused on 2026 TV premiere dates *in general*, not specifically anime. Those sources don't contain information about anime episode counts or summaries. \n\nI can, however, recommend some anime similar to *Attack on Titan* based on its themes of dark fantasy, action, and complex storylines. Here are a few, with summaries and episode counts (as of today, November 21, 2023):\n\n*   **Vinland Saga:** (Available on Kiroflix) A historical epic set in Viking-age England, following Thorfinn, a young warrior seeking revenge for his father's death. It explores themes of violence, revenge, and finding meaning in life. **Episodes:** 24 (Season 1), 24 (Season 2)\n*   **Claymore:** In a world plagued by shape-shifting demons called Yoma, a half-human, half-Yoma warrior known as a Claymore is created to hunt them. The story follows Clare, a Claymore, as she battles demons and uncovers a dark conspiracy. **Episodes:** 26\n*   **Berserk:** (May be available on Kiroflix depending on region) A dark fantasy epic following Guts, a lone mercenary, as he battles demons and struggles against fate. It's known for its brutal action, complex characters, and mature themes. *Please be aware this series contains very mature content.* **Episodes:** 25 (1997 series), 12 (Golden Age Arc Movie Trilogy), 24 (2016-2017 series)\n*   **Devilman Crybaby:** (Available on Kiroflix) When a shy young man merges with a demon, he gains immense power but must fight against other demons to protect humanity. It's a visually striking and emotionally intense series. **Episodes:** 10\n\n**About Kiroflix:** Kiroflix is a streaming platform dedicated to anime. We offer an extensive library with advanced features designed for the ultimate anime viewing experience!\n\n\n\nWould you like more recommendations, or perhaps details on where to find these titles on Kiroflix (availability may vary by region)?"
